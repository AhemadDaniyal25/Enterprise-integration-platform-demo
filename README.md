# Enterprise Integration & Low-Code Platform Demo

This repository demonstrates a lightweight enterprise integration platform inspired by real-world integration teams in large industrial organizations.

The project focuses on API-based service exposure, standardized data exchange formats, and documentation-first design to support onboarding, reuse, and internal adoption.

---

## Purpose

Enterprise integration teams often need to:
- Expose internal services in a standardized way
- Support multiple data formats (JSON, XML)
- Enable low-code frontends for self-service access
- Provide clear documentation for internal users

This demo simulates those patterns in a minimal, practical way.

## Architecture Overview

- **Backend:** FastAPI-based REST services
- **Data Formats:** JSON and XML
- **Design Focus:** Clear API contracts and documentation
- **Intended Consumers:** Low-code tools such as Microsoft PowerApps or internal portals
